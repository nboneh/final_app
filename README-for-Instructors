Greetings instructors. 

We hope you enjoy testing out "MyBook" and all of its features. We believe that
all of the requirements have been met, and that the site is fully functional. 
If given more time the team would devote more effort to commenting and documenting the code 
as well as a more complete set of Rspec tests. We would also clean up the CSS 
a bit and make the app more user friendly
